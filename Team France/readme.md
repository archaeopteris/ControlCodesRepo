Team France "We Robot"
=====================

Team France designed a robot with:

* 4 DC Motors for the driving train (`AVD` / `AVG` / `ARD` / `ARG` motors for "Front Right and Left" and "Rear Right and Left")

* 3 DC Motors for other actions : Hanger for the lifting mechanism, `montePanier` to lift our basket and `roueTri` for our sorter

* 3 Servo Motors : `sortieOranges` and `sortieBleues` for releasing sorted balls and `verrouPanier` to lock our basket while in  high position

* 1 colorSensor.

The opMode launches three threads : the main one, one for the sorting system and one for handling the moves.
