Team Finland's "Kyösti Yrjänä"
===============================

Team Finland decided to build a quick and agile tripod design. It has seven DCMotors and no servos. The motors `moottori1`, `moottori2` and `moottori3` control the wheels. The motors `harja1`, `harja2` and `harja3` control the external combs. The motor `nostin` actuates the lifting mechanism. `imu` refers to the inertial measurement unit on the main control hub. The sensors `color1`, `color2` and `color3` are used as distance sensors to aida gauge the robot's angle and improve its balance.
